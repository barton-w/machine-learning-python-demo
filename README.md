# Machine Learning - Python Demo

### In this tutorial I perform various operations on the famous Iris Flowers dataset, which is a popular intro-to-ML exercise.

### Steps to interact with the materials in this repo:
1. [Browse the Overview slides to learn about key-concepts.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14pzJLsGrJKwv_9sjqBu4zxF6JJ7LVvL0I8dr4WnWwvE/edit?usp=sharing)

2. Install a handful SciPy packages. More info [here.](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
  * scipy
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * sklearn
  * matplotlib

3. Run iris_flowers.py using Python 3. Uncomment, and comment-out various sections of the code to perform different visualizations, model comparisons, and analysis.
